# xcorganize
**A python tool to download and organize Xeno-Canto audio files for machine learning projects.**

Xeno-Canto (`https://www.xeno-canto.org/`) is a data treasure. But the data cannot be directly used in machine learning processes (feature extraction, train, test) because it first need to be organized. This toolset allows to download and organise XC data in a structured repository tree that can be directly accesd by your ML processes. 
The tool is meant for incrementally adding consistently with previously used data. 

## Summary
- check summaries before download (e.g. typos in species name, licences)
- lightweight meta-data format easy to postprocess with python
- explicit selection of mp3 file duration and licence
- nested dirs with basic conversion (mp3 tp wav, resample)

Use the following general guidelines when rating recordings on xeno-canto. Ratings are obviously subjective, and will inevitably vary slightly between different individuals, but these guidelines should improve consistency.
    A: Loud and Clear
    B: Clear, but bird a bit distant, or some interference with other sound sources
    C: Moderately clear, or quite some interference
    D: Faint recording, or much interference
    E: Barely audible
