Use the following general guidelines when rating recordings on xeno-canto. Ratings are obviously subjective, and will inevitably vary slightly between different individuals, but these guidelines should improve consistency.
    A: Loud and Clear
    B: Clear, but bird a bit distant, or some interference with other sound sources
    C: Moderately clear, or quite some interference
    D: Faint recording, or much interference
    E: Barely audible
